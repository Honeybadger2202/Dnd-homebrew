			<p class="flavor">The rhinox are a group of humanoids with the thick hides, and heads of a rhinoceros, complete with a large single horn protruding from the tops of their head. Rhinox rear their young in family groups called a crash, and travel wide savannahs chasing seasons and favored tastes in fruit, berries and green, leafy plants. A rhinox is not born with a horn. The horn begins to grow at when a young rhinox reach adolescence, usually at around six years of age, and reaches full size around the time a rhinox reaches adulthood two years later. Urban rhinox are rare, as most prefer the wind and solitude of the open savannah, where their considerable bulk is not considered a nuisance. Rhinox are so large and heavy that most furniture cannot withstand their weight, and fitting through doorways meant for most humanoids can be a daily challenge for them. Most rhinox revere and even worship fey, from which they are descended.</p>
